						Using the right architecture can greatly increase the success rate of a software development project. Not only will it make the code more structured and tidy, it can also reduce potential problems such as coupling. However, not all architecture patterns are suitable for UpStage, and so the project team decided to investigate several options to try and evaluate which architecture would work best for the project. The options are:
						<ul>
							<li>Model-View-Controller</li>
							<li>Microservices Architecture</li>
							<li>Event-Driven Architecture</li>
						</ul>

						We have contacted Martin who is the developer of DownStage via Email to get some useful ideas of designing architecture for cyberformance. He replied us with information about the architecture of DownStage that he is planning to develop in the future. DownStage is only a back-end abstracting the network and event layers which offers API’s for a front-end communicating with RPC mechanism. The approach he is going to implement is CQRS pattern (See http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html). The main idea of the overall architecture is “Separation of Concerns”, which we think that is well-designed. We also thought that is would be great if we can build the new UpStage on the top of his system if it existed. His architecture seems to be very modular and requiring high level of knowledge of designing architecture. There are simpler ways to implement the new UpStage instead of using the architecture he provided. Our team will keep considering the concept that he has for DownStage while we develop the new UpStage to make it modular so that it is easy to maintain and extend in the future. We tried to draw an architecture diagram as Martin explained to make ourselves understand his architecture.

						Before the project team starts developing the new UpStage, we need to decide which programming language to use for developing it. The existing UpStage has been developed with Python. The clients have said that the team does not need to stick with Python for the new UpStage. They will be satisfied as long as the team completes this project and delivers a high quality product. All members might want to use the programming language they are most familiar with, but what we need to consider is whether it is the best programming language that is suitable to generate the required product with good quality. Each team member has chosen one programming language and researched on it to find out its advantages and disadvantages based on several criteria we have decided, so that we can decide which language is suitable for the new UpStage. The researched languages are:
						<ul>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>Java</li>
							<li>C#</li>
							<li>Node.js</li>
						</ul>
						We have also conducted prototyping. We made a simple version of UpStage in C# and Java. To see more details about proof of concept, please see the document.

						In order to store the persistent data for UpStage, the team have conducted an investigation of several types of data storage. Any comparison of data storages depends heavily on the data that needs to be stored. The candidates are:
						<ul>
							<li>XML</li>
							<li>Rational Database</li>
							<li>JSON</li>
						</ul>

		<p>
		  These high priority issues remain open as they cannot be fixed due to the design of current software. According to the predecessor teams, these issues are not repeatable by AUT team. This statement has been proven false. All the identified issues indicate faults from the media synchronization mechanism within the current implementation. We produced a full detailed analysis to demonstrate how to reinstate these issues.
